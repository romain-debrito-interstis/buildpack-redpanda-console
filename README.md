# APT buildpack

Add support for apt-based dependencies during both compile and runtime.

Added ability to also specify custom repositories through **:repo:** in `Aptfile` (see example below).

## Usage

This buildpack is not meant to be used on its own, and instead should be in used in combination with Scalingo's [multiple buildpack support](https://doc.scalingo.com/buildpacks/multi).

Include a list of apt package names to be installed in a file named `Aptfile`.

To find out what packages are available, see:
<https://packages.ubuntu.com>

See the [Scalingo stacks](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/internals/stacks/stacks) documentation for which Ubuntu LTS version is used by each stack.

#### Setup

Configure your app with multi buildpacks:

```
scalingo env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack
```

Example of `.buildpacks` file:

```
https://github.com/Scalingo/apt-buildpack
https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack
```

Note that the order of the buildpacks in the `.buildpacks` file matters.

## Example

#### Aptfile

    # you can list packages
    libexample-dev
    
    # or include links to specific .deb files
    https://downloads.example.com/example.deb
    
    # or add custom apt repos (only required if using packages outside of the standard Ubuntu APT repositories)
    :repo:deb https://apt.example.com/ example-distro main
